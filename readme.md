Customization
You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with FIXME: for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

public/apple-touch-icon.png, public/favicon.ico, public/favicon-16x16.png and public/favicon-32x32.png: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
src/styles/global.css: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
src/utils/AppConfig.ts: configuration file
src/templates/Main.tsx: default theme
next-sitemap.config.js: sitemap configuration
You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit 🚀.

Commit Message Format
The project enforces Conventional Commits specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses Commitizen, an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

npm run commit
One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a CHANGELOG file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

Deploy to production
You can see the results locally in production mode with:

$ npm run build
$ npm run start
The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also remove unused CSS from Tailwind CSS.

You can create an optimized production build with:

npm run build-prod
Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at out folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

Testing
All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the pages folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a pages.test folder to write tests from files located in pages folder.

Deploy to Netlify
Clone this repository on own GitHub account and deploy to Netlify:

Netlify Deploy button

Deploy to Vercel
Deploy this Next JS Boilerplate on Vercel in one click:

Deploy with Vercel

VSCode information (optional)
If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in .vscode/extension.json. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with Cmd + Shift + B on Mac.
